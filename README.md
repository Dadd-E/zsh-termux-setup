To install zsh, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, and powerlevel10k in Termux, follow these steps:

Step 1: Update Termux Packages
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
Step 2: Install Required Packages
Install zsh, git, and curl:

pkg install -y zsh git curl
Step 3: Install Oh My Zsh
Run the Oh My Zsh installer:

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
When prompted, confirm to set zsh as your default shell.
Step 4: Install Plugins
zsh-autosuggestions (auto-completion):
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
zsh-syntax-highlighting (colorful syntax):
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
Step 5: Install Powerlevel10k Theme
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
Step 6: Configure .zshrc
Open your .zshrc file:
nano ~/.zshrc
Set the theme:
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
Enable plugins (add to the plugins line):
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
Save changes (Ctrl + S) and exit (Ctrl + X).
Step 7: Apply Changes
Reload your shell configuration:

source ~/.zshrc
The Powerlevel10k configuration wizard will start. Follow the prompts to customize your prompt. If you skip it, run p10k configure later.

Step 8: Fix Font Issues (Optional)
Powerlevel10k requires special fonts for icons. Install Termux:Styling from the Play Store/F-Droid to set a compatible font (e.g., MesloLGS NF). Alternatively, configure Powerlevel10k to use ASCII mode during setup.

Troubleshooting
If plugins donâ€™t load, ensure the paths in .zshrc are correct.
Use exec zsh to restart Zsh if needed.
